### GIT
Link: https://github.com/kazu09161999/Assignment2_3813ICT.git
The layout of my git repository is containing the project folder which includes frontend and backend and a README file. The default branch is called main.

### GIT version control

My approach to commit when I developed is commit every time, I made something like user interface, function, server, data and so on to avoid losing the data with any happening and error.
